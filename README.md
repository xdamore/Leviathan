# Leviathan

A tiny static “business card” website I built mostly for fun, boredom, and vibes lol.

## 🚀 What Is This?
**Leviathan** is a super simple static page with three clickable nicknames.  
Each link sends visitors to a Telegram account — mine and two of my friends.  
No backend, no analytics, no fancy tricks. Just a clean little hub that exists because… why not lmao.

## 🙏 Credits
Big shoutout to **Reikolol** (author of **lucifer.run**) — the original codebase this project is based on.

I’m not claiming originality or authorship over the core structure.  
I was just messing around with HTML/CSS as a self-taught newbie (and it kinda shows lol).  
Much respect to the original creator.
