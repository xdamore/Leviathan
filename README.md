# Leviathan

A tiny static “business card” website I built mostly for fun, boredom, and vibes lol.

## 🚀 What Is This?
**Leviathan** is a super simple static page with three clickable nicknames.  
Each link sends visitors to a Telegram account - mine and two of my friends.  
No backend, no analytics, no fancy tricks. Just a clean little hub that exists because… why not lmao.

## 🙏 Credits
Big shoutout to **Reikolol** (author of **lucifer.run**) - the original codebase this project is based on.

I’m not claiming originality or authorship over the core structure.  
I’m basically a self-taught newbie who just dived into the code, didn’t know much at first, and learned as I went, tweaking stuff and adding my own small ideas along the way (lol).  
Much respect to the original creator.
